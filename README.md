# ECS Cluster

Build an Amazon Elastic Container Services Cluster with Terraform to deploy an test application

## Requirements

* An AWS account and an IAM user with permissions to create AWS resources

- terraform v0.11.14
- provider.aws v2.45.0

- docker 19.03.5
- aws-cli 1.16.240


## Introduction

This will create an ECS cluster, made up of a set of three nodes in an auto-scaling group across the three availability zones specified 
and deploys the application.

#### in a nutshell, it has..

* VPC with Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Public and Private subnets
* ECS Cluster in with EC2 type - nodes inside private subnet and attached with autoscaling group
* Service deployed in ECS with auto-scaling
* Private S3 bucket and ECS tasks allowed to write to it.
* Application Loadbalancer in-front of the application


## Usage - To run the code,

Export IAM credentials as environment variables unless you are using AWS roles
```
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="accesskey"
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="secretkey"
$ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"
```

#### Build the nginx image with custom port

Create Repository in AWS ECR (for storing the custom nginx image)

```
$ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name nginx
```

Note down the `repositoryUri` from the output


Build the docker images with two available artifact versions
```
cd nginx/
docker build . -t <repositoryUri>:tag
```

Example:
```
docker build . -t xxxxx.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/nginx:latest
```

Push the docker images to ECR (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-push-ecr-image.html)

1. Login into ECR 

    Example: `eval $(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region us-east-1 | sed 's|https://||')`

2. Push the images built

    Example: `docker push xxxxxx.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/nginx:latest`

Note: If you have authentication issues while pushing, try login with the help of https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper


#### If you still have troubles, you can use my public image : `vineethvijay/nginx-custom-port:latest` ;)


## Running the Terraform, 

Change the `image` under terraform/files/nginx-task.json

```
cd terraform/
terraform init

terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Access the nginx page with the output endpoint (it may take couple of seconds..)
You may also check the in AWS ECS service console to see whether the tasks are in `RUNNING` state, 
also the `Target Group` to see if the listeners are healthy.
